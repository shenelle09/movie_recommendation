Movie Recommendation System using Apriori Algorithm in Python

The paradox of choice, popularized by psychologist Barry Schwartz in his 2004 book "The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less," explores how the abundance of choices in modern Western societies affects happiness. Despite the association between choice and freedom, Schwartz discovered that an excess of options doesn't necessarily lead to greater satisfaction. In fact, having too many choices often results in people feeling less content with their decisions, as they become overwhelmed and find it difficult to make the "best" choice. Schwartz's work highlights the fine balance between the freedom to choose and the potential drawbacks of an overabundance of options.

Thus, recommendation systems play a pivotal role in simplifying decision-making by providing customized suggestions based on user's preferences and behaviors. These systems harness the power of advanced algorithms and data analysis to streamline the decision-making process, relieving individuals of the overwhelming burden of choice overload and ultimately enhancing their overall satisfaction. 

In this project, the Apriori algorithm is used to perform market basket analysis on data consisting of 20,000,263 user ratings, across 100836 movies and 610 raters. It was proposed by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant in 1994 and has since become a fundamental tool in market basket analysis and other fields. 

Here are some key points about the Apriori algorithm:

Association Rule Mining: Apriori is primarily used for discovering association rules in datasets. Association rules are if-then statements that help identify relationships or patterns between different items in a dataset.

Market Basket Analysis: One of the most common applications of Apriori is in market basket analysis, where it is used to identify items that are frequently purchased together. For example, in a retail setting, it can help identify that customers who buy bread are likely to buy butter as well.
